## Hi there üëã

I'm a Computer Science Student with a focus on contributing to Free and Open Source Software. I've made Contributions to prominent open-source projects including ![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Swift-FA7343?logo=swift&logoColor=white), ![Chromium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Chromium-4285F4?logo=google-chrome&logoColor=white), ![LLVM](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LLVM-262D3F?logo=llvm&logoColor=white) and ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=white). These contributions have helped me gain valuable experience and enhance my skills in software development, coding, and collaborative work in diverse open-source environments.

Open source gave a great opporutunity to Work in a team environment, communicate and coordinate with other contributors, tackle real-world problems, debug and fix issues in existing, often massive codebases like LLVM and Chromium.
