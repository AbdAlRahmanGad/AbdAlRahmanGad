## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Student with a focus on contributing to Free and Open Source Software. I've made Contributions to prominent open-source projects including `Swift`, `Chromium`, `LLDB` and `Git`. These contributions have helped me gain valuable experience and enhance my skills in software development, coding, and collaborative work in diverse open-source environments.

Open source gave a great opporutunity to Work in a team environment, communicate and coordinate with other contributors, tackle real-world problems, debug and fix issues in existing, often massive codebases like LLVM and Chromium.

A list of my open-source contributions can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/AbdAlRahmanGad/23df2d40326ef665422d261faef211b6).
